### Goal ###

I want to be able to observe standard CT processes (e.g., neutral, conformist, mixtures) in a regional "metapopulation" made up of connected subpopulations, keeping track both of raw traits, and viewing simulation results through classifications, as I did with a single population.  Additional observable quantities may come into play, in terms of the spread and reach of classes and traits through subpopulations.
