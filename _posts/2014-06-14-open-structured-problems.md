This is mainly a placeholder for a long list of open questions that came to mind while working on our recent [semantic axelrod model](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5704) paper.  I'll organize it later, and have already outlined some [next steps](/structured%20information%20project/2014/04/26/semantic-next-steps.html) for non-equilibrium, diachronic analyses.
