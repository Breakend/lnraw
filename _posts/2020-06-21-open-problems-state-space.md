#### How large is the space of Laplacian spectra on unlabelled trees with N vertices?  

Cayley's theorem tells us the number of possible unlabelled trees on $N$ vertices:  $n^{n-2}$.  This can be very large (e.g., for $n=20$, around $10^{23}$).  But the number of distinguishable Laplacian spectra may be much smaller.  It is worth understanding how large this state space of spectra may be for different numbers of assemblages.

#### Is there a useful notion of the "spectrum" of a time varying graph?
