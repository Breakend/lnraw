### Problem Statement ###

Traditional archaeological seriation generated solutions that always had a static linear order, either by use of a multidimensional scaling algorithm or via Fordian manual shuffling of assemblages.  In such context, departures from a "correct" solution can be measured by the number of "out of order" assemblages (or via a more opaque "stress" statistic in some cases).
