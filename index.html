				<p>I study the evolution of human culture, using the framework of Darwinian evolutionary theory.  
					As an anthropologist, my focus is upon large-scale and long-term patterns in cultural change.  
					My research projects focus upon the connection between micro-scale, individual level processes (such as social learning, strategic interaction, 
					and the structure of technological knowledge), and their macroscopic and macroevolutionary results.</p>
