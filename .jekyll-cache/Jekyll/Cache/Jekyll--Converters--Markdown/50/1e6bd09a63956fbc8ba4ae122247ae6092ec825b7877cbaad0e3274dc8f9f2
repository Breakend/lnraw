<h3 id="effect-of-varying-sample-size">Effect of Varying Sample Size</h3>
<p>After SAA’s, I used some existing simulations (seriationct-27 from the <a href="http://github.com/mmadsen/experiment-seriationct-2">experiment-seriationct-2</a> repository) to prototype examining the effects of sample size on:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The gross structure of the seriation solutions: how much branching when small? do we get isolates?<br />
</li>
<li>Lineage structure recovery</li>
</ol>
<p>Working with the existing simulation results and post-processed samples, I wrote a quick modification of the assemblage sampler called <code>seriationct-sample-assemblages-for-samplesize-sequence-seriation.py</code>. The script takes the output from the <code>seriationct-export-data.py</code> script and performs subsampling as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Uses a <code>samplefraction</code> parameter to select an initial sample of assemblages, just like the normal <code>seriationct-sample-assemblages-for-seriation.py</code>.<br />
</li>
<li>Selects these samples given the <code>sampletype</code> parameter, as a pure random sample of assemblages, a spatially stratified sample given NxN quadrats, temporally stratified given N even periods of time, and spatiotemporal sampling which stratifies by quadrats and periods.</li>
<li>Subsamples the <code>samplefraction</code> assemblages in a sequence decreasing by 2, so for example, if <code>samplefraction</code> is 30, the largest set of assemblages will be 30 randomly sampled, and then 28 sampled from the 30, 26 sampled from the original 30, and so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>The net result is a nested series of samples (rather than independent random samples of different sizes).</p>
<h3 id="statistics-brainstorm">Statistics Brainstorm</h3>
<p>Some of the things I want to know are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How consistent is the lineage structure of each seriation solution, at each sample size? (i.e., along a branch, how mixed are lineage identifiers?)</li>
<li>How consistent is the temporal sequence of the solution?<br />
</li>
<li>How “branchy” is the solution?<br />
</li>
<li>Furthermore, what is the average and variance of these measures, across the sequence of sample sizes? Or perhaps the quantiles and order statistics?</li>
<li>At what sample size does lineage structure and chronology become visible and semi-stable?</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m just starting to build measures for these items, since they involve traversal and parsing of the annotated minmax graphs.</p>
