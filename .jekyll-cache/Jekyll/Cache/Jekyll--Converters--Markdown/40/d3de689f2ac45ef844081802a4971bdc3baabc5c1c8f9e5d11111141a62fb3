I"<p>I participated in two papers today at the 2016 meetings of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society, in Vancouver, B.C. The first was solo work, titled “Computational Methods for Identifying Metapopulation Interaction Patterns From Seriation Solutions.” The <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/madsen2016-hbes-computational-interaction-patterns-slides_pdf/3468650">presentation slides are on Figshare now.</a></p>
<p>The second paper was jointly done with Carl P. Lipo, and comprises work on new variations on seriation methods. The title is: “Continuity-based approaches to seriation and the study of patterns of cultural inheritance”. The <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/lipomadsen2016-hbes-continuity-inheritance_pdf/3468653">presentation slides are on Figshare now.</a></p>
