<p>Equifinality-4 fixes a couple of lacunae in the feature set for classification, and drops the purely sampled data set until another paper on object analysis. It compares population census versus time averaged and sampled data, for aggregate assemblages like ceramics or lithics. I include Neiman‚Äôs <span class="math inline">\(t_f\)</span> diversity measure, since it‚Äôs widely used, although I doubt it tells us anything that Shannon entropy does not.</p>
<p>I am not including power law exponent fits. This may be controversial, since Premo found that they continued to have diagnostic value with time averaged data. But Mesoudi and Lycett, and probably Bentley originally, are calculating the power law exponent in a way that seems strange with respect to <strong>archaeologically measurable</strong> variables, so that needs further analysis. M&amp;L‚Äôs code (from the 2009 paper) clearly aggregates the total number of agents across the entire simulation time span that adopted a given trait. Thus, the ‚Äúfrequency‚Äù of a trait in their analysis is not the fraction of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (total population size) in which the trait is represented at a given point in time. It‚Äôs more like the ‚Äúcumulative adoption‚Äù of a trait. This is what gives them data points in the <span class="math inline">\(10^4\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(10^6\)</span> range on their log-log plot when population sizes in the simulation are in the hundreds.</p>
<p>When you do try to calculate the power law exponent on frequencies from a single time slice, the numbers are pretty unstable, because in a small population none of the counts exceed N, which is on the order of hundreds. And with a small number of traits represented in any given sample, most of the algorithms simply can‚Äôt calculate the exponent.</p>
<p>So I need to think more about situations where the power-law exponent does seem to be useful, and check how Premo calculated it, because in theory it seems to be robust to time averaging effects, but it‚Äôs possible that this is because it‚Äôs only calculable on large amounts of aggregate data. Carl Lipo suggested something along these lines in conversation recently.</p>
<h3 id="analysis-run">Analysis Run</h3>
<p>I started <code>equifinality-4</code> on data re-exported (with the V2.5 data export script) from the <code>equifinality-3</code> database, on 12/13/14. The analysis is occurring on two EC2 16-core instances, and should be complete in just over 24 hours.</p>
