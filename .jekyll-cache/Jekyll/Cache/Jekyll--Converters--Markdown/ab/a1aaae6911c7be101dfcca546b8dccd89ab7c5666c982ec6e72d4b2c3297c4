<p>I am starting the first batch of 40,000 simulation runs today, labeled <code>equifinality-1</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/mmadsen/experiment-ctmixtures/tree/master/simulations/equifinality-1">configuration files and job scripts</a> are located in the <code>simulations/equifinality-1</code> directory of my <code>experiment-ctmixtures</code> GitHub repository. The gzipped tar archive <code>ctmixtures-equifinality-1.tar.gz</code> contains 400 job scripts, the simulation configuration files for each model, and a copy of the <code>ctmixtures-2.3</code> software, and can be used to replicate this experiment either with or without StarCluster, on a local computer or other cloud computing service.</p>
<h4 id="models-and-priors">Models and Priors</h4>
<p>All simulations are performed for 1MM steps in a Moran population dynamic with 100 individuals, so 10K generations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Equal proportions of anti- and conformist transmission</li>
<li>70% conformism, 30% anticonformism</li>
<li>30% conformism, 70% anticonformism</li>
<li>100% purely neutral copying</li>
</ul>
<p>All models share a uniform prior distribution on innovation in the range <span class="math inline">\([0.1, 5.0]\)</span>, in scaled units. Conformist mixtures all share uniform prior distributions on the strength of the bias from the range <span class="math inline">\([0.05, 0.25]\)</span>.</p>
<p>All models allow the population to reach quasi-stationary equilibrium, and take a synchronic snapshot sample of the population of two sizes: 10 and 20 individuals from the total of 100. That synchronic snapshot occurs in time step 1MM, at the conclusion of the simulation run.</p>
<p>All models also perform time-averaged observations over a set of durations <span class="math inline">\([10,25,50,100]\)</span> generations long (nb. 1 generation = 100 time steps in this model given the conversion between WF and Moran dynamics).</p>
<p>All models also calculate the Kandler-Shennan trait survival over a duration of 50 generations, both with synchronic point observations at the beginning and end of the 50 generation block, and with observations on each end which are time averaged for <span class="math inline">\([10,25,50,100]\)</span> generations. This will allow analysis of the effect of time averaged observations on Kandler and Shennanâ€™s non-equilibrium survival method.</p>
<p>Each simulation run is given a random seed, which is saved with the simulation results, and a label indicating which model was used, which is also saved with the simulation results. The latter will form the basis for training a classification model (SVM and random forest), and evaluating out-of-sample performance on a test data set.</p>
<h4 id="timing">Timing</h4>
<p>Started the 400 jobs around 9:50am on 9/16. Projecting a completion sometime on Saturday, but some of the conformist models are taking about 3 minutes, not 4.3, so the batch could be done sooner, will keep an eye on it to minimize cost.</p>
<h4 id="completion">Completion</h4>
<p>The runs consistently took a shorter time than my initial tests on an EC2 instance suggested, and close to the time on my laptop, so the total wall-clock time for the 40,000 runs was around 54.5 hours. Execution costs were $120.00 almost exactly.</p>
