<p>Cayley‚Äôs theorem tells us the number of possible unlabelled trees on <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> vertices: <span class="math inline">\(n^{n-2}\)</span>. This can be very large (e.g., for <span class="math inline">\(n=20\)</span>, around <span class="math inline">\(10^{23}\)</span>). But the number of distinguishable Laplacian spectra may be much smaller. It is worth understanding how large this state space of spectra may be for different numbers of assemblages.</p>
