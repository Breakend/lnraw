I"Q<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Given a quick profiling, there aren’t obvious standouts, I’m simply doing a lot of operations many many times. But the graph library (networkx) is slow compared to others with a C/C++ backend, and I do graph operations tens of millions of times in a standard run. So that’s the obvious optimization, rewrite with a faster graph library.</p>
<h3 id="nonequilibrium-analysis">Nonequilibrium Analysis</h3>
<p>I could do more static equilibrium analysis, but most of the interesting empirical hypotheses involve dynamics. In particular, four experiments suggest themselves after building some infrastructure for it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Evolving Learning Rates</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Holding the size of the design space and the innovation rate constant, what happens to radius and other measures as the learning rate evolves (increases)? This is a better analysis of what happens with greater fidelity learning than comparing two static analyses with different parameters.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Design Space Evolution</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Holding learning rate and innovation rate constant, what happens when the design space evolves? I can implement this by configuring a design space with 16 trees, but only initializing the population from 4 of the trees (or whatever), but allowing individual innovation to access all 16. Over a long time frame, how does the fraction of design space filled evolve? If we keep track of the “level” of innovations – whole new trees, or leaves on an existing tree, what do the rates of major and minor technical innovations look like? Does breadth and radius evolve together over time?</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Design Space and Fidelity</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In an evolving design space, what happens when we change the learning rate, holding the innovation rate constant?</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>Full Monty</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In an evolving design space, what happens when we increase both fidelity, and the individual innovation rate as the design space increases in size?</p>
